# Wireframes Documentation: AI Cybersecurity Threat Detection
This folder contains UI wireframes that represent the system's design and functionality.

## Included Files
threat-overview/ – Wireframes for monitoring cybersecurity threats.
AI_Cybersecurity_Dashboard.png – The final exported Figma UI showcasing the security dashboard.

## Features in the Threat Overview UI

### 1. AI Threat Score
- Displays an AI-calculated security score (e.g., 85% Safe).
- Uses a circular progress indicator to visually represent system security.
- Colors indicate risk levels:
  - Green (Safe) – No immediate threats.
  - Orange (Medium) – Some suspicious activity detected.
  - Red (Critical) – Immediate threat detected.

### 2. Threat Levels
- Categorized threats into three levels:
  - Critical (Red) – Urgent security breaches.
  - Medium (Orange) – Potential threats needing attention.
  - Low (Green) – Minor risks.

### 3. Attack Trends Graph
- A line graph displaying cybersecurity attack trends in the last 24 hours.
- Helps security teams identify patterns in attack frequency.

### 4. World Map of Threats
- Displays a map with red dots marking locations of active cyber threats.
- Provides a global perspective on threat sources.

### 5. Automated AI Response
- Dropdowns and toggles for security actions:
  - Quarantine System
  - Block IP
  - Investigate Further

## Next Steps
- Implement interactive UI components based on this wireframe.
- Connect the threat data to real-time cybersecurity logs.
- Enhance AI Threat Score calculations with machine learning models.

# Problem Statement: AI-Powered Cybersecurity Threat Detection

## Challenges in Current Cybersecurity Solutions

1. Delayed Threat Detection: Traditional security tools often fail to detect threats in real time, leading to data breaches.
2. High False Positive Rates: Security teams face alert fatigue due to excessive false alarms, making it hard to identify real threats.
3. Manual Intervention: Many security incidents require manual response, which slows down reaction time and increases risks.

## Need for an AI-Powered Solution
1. Real-Time Threat Detection: AI continuously monitors network activity and detects threats instantly.
2. Automated Incident Response: AI-powered automation helps contain threats before they escalate.
3. Predictive Security Analysis: AI models can predict and prevent attacks by analyzing historical attack patterns.
